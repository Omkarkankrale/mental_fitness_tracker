### The Mental Fitness Tracker project, developed during my IBM AI/ML internship, focuses on predicting an individual's mental fitness based on various features. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, our model analyzes factors such as daily activities, sleep patterns, exercise routines, and mood indicators to provide insights into one's mental well-being. By tracking and interpreting these data points, our system offers personalized recommendations and interventions to promote better mental health outcomes. This project represents a significant step forward in utilizing AI for proactive mental wellness monitoring and support.
